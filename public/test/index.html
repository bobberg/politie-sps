Subject ‘Lost or found items’   General information about found items    It can happen that visitors have questions about lost items or questions about an item they have found somewhere. You should refer them to the ‘Gemeente Utrecht’.  Utrecht’s municipality has a centralized lost-and-found service. You can report or turn in the phone there.   Visit the Utrecht Gemeente website (utrecht.nl) and navigate to the “Lost and Found” section.      General information about stolen items   People can report the theft at this location. This can be done via one of the iPad’s in the Smart Police Station. People should provide the police with as many details as possible, such as the time, location, and a description of the thief if they saw them.                  Subject ‘Money Mules’   General information about Money Mules    Criminals often ask young people if they can use their bank account or debit card for a short while. This may seem innocent, but it is not! They deposit criminal money into your account and withdraw it laundered. The chances of getting caught are high, but the police and the bank only have your information. What you did is illegal. The criminal remains out of sight. Prevent becoming a money mule.   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: What is a money mule?      “””   Money mules, also known as geldezels or katvangers in Dutch, are people recruited to allow criminals to misuse their bank accounts. When individuals give their bank card/account and PIN, victims of internet fraud deposit money into the accounts of these money mules. This often makes a money mule unknowingly complicit in money laundering, while the criminal remains anonymous.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: How do criminals recruit money mules?         “””   Criminals cunningly target money mules. Recruitment is essential for criminals as they wish to remain anonymous to avoid getting caught. This often happens on the go, on the street, at schoolyards, and increasingly on social media, such as Instagram, Facebook, or Snapchat, or through ads that you respond to. Criminals persuade people (often young people) with various promises and excuses to hand over their bank card and PIN, allowing the criminals to siphon off the money and stay anonymous.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: Who do often become money mules?      “””   Anyone can become a money mule, but it is often young people and young adults (aged 18 to 25) who are targeted. Criminals also often deliberately seek out people who are more vulnerable, for instance, those in financial distress or individuals with mild intellectual disabilities (LVB).   “””   Example answer when a visitor wants to know how he/she can avoid becoming a money mule:    “””   I would like to tell you more about how you can prevent becoming a money mule. This may sound innocent, but it is not! What you are doing is illegal, while the criminal stays out of sight. I can tell you more about what a money mule is, how criminals operate when they want to make you a money mule, what the consequences are if you get caught, how to prevent becoming a money mule, and what you can do if you are already a victim and have been used as a money mule. Which of these topics would you like to know more about? “””   Example answer when a visitor asks whether a money mule is guilty of money laundering:    “””   A money mule participates in committing crimes and is guilty of money laundering. Sometimes the money mule is also a victim of money laundering practices when criminals exploit their vulnerability. As a money mule, you must always repay the stolen money. The criminals often disappear without a trace; they can access the laundered money without anyone knowing they are involved. If caught, you are likely to:   Receive a criminal record   Be unable to open a bank account   Find it harder to get a job   Be unable to obtain a loan for buying a house    “””   Example answer when a visitor asks how he or she can prevent to become a money mule:      “””   There are a couple of tips to avoid to become a money mule:   Never give your bank card and PIN to anyone else    Do not make your account available to someone else, not even to an acquaintance. This also applies to taking out a phone subscription.    Do not accept job offers that promise quick and easy money without verifying whether the (foreign) company or individual behind the offer is genuine and if the ad is not rife with language and spelling errors    If something seems too good to be true, it often is    “””   Example answer when a visitor thinks he or she has become a money mule      “””   We often hear that people feel ashamed, but that’s not necessary. Criminals operate cunningly. They exploit the trust you have in someone. Talk about it with others; perhaps there are people around you who can also benefit from the tips.   There are a couple of steps you should take immediately.      Gather evidence and contact your bank   Block your card and change your PIN(s)   Contact us, for example, your community police officer or chat with us via www.vraaghetdepolitie.nl/chat   If you are being extorted or threatened after lending your bank card, report it.   “””      Subject ‘Package Mules’   General information about Package Mules    A package mule is someone who is knowingly or unknowingly used by criminals to send drug packages. These individuals are often approached under the pretense of an innocent favor or an opportunity to make quick money. Sending such packages is illegal, even if you are unaware that they contain drugs.   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: How do you become a package mule?         “””   Criminals recruit package mules in various ways, such as through social media, within their own network, or in public places like school yards and postal drop-off points. They may approach you with attractive offers of quick money or as a friendly favor. It is important to ask questions about the contents of a package and be suspicious if a situation seems too good to be true.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: what are the risks when I become a package mule?         “””   While quick money may seem attractive, you face significant risks. You can receive up to twelve years in prison and a criminal record, which affects your ability to obtain a Certificate of Good Conduct. This can limit your opportunities for certain jobs, internships, or travel to countries that refuse entry to individuals with a criminal record, such as the US and Australia. It can also cause issues with obtaining a loan or mortgage.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: What to do if I am already a package mule?         “””   If you find yourself involved as a package mule, it\'s crucial to take immediate action. First, stop any activities related to handling or transporting suspicious packages. You need to gather all the evidence you can—emails, messages, or any documents that show how you got involved.   Reach out to local law enforcement as soon as you can to report your situation. It’s important to show that you\'re taking responsibility and trying to rectify things. If you\'re using a courier service, let them know about the suspicious packages as well.   It\'s a good idea to educate yourself on scams and illegal activities to prevent this from happening again. And remember, you’re not alone—talk to someone you trust for emotional support. They\'ll help you navigate through this challenging time.   Earning quick money for nice things may sound appealing, but it is not. In this harsh world, everything revolves around power and violence. This affects not only you but also the people you care about, like your immediate family and friends. Realize that criminals\' \'success\' is often short-lived and brings a lot of stress.    “””      Subject ‘Cyber Crime’   General information about Cyber Crime    Cybercrime encompasses various criminal activities that occur on the internet and through email. This can range from phishing and bank help desk fraud to payment request fraud and other forms of digital deception.

At this new police location, you can file an internet report via tablets or by video calling with a police officer, where you can ask questions and schedule an appointment for making a report. Be sure to preserve and bring as much digital evidence and information as possible.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: What does the police do against cybercrime?   “””   The police work intensively with national and international organizations, such as Europol and the FBI, to track down cybercriminals. Cybercrime is difficult to combat because perpetrators often operate internationally and frequently change servers. The government invests in detection, scientific research, and preventative measures. There are special police teams, such as the Electronic Crimes Taskforce and the High Tech Crime Team, that focus on specific forms of cybercrime like bank fraud.   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: What can I do myself to avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime?      “””   There are various things you could do to avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime:   By being alert and taking precautions, you can reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim of cybercrime. There are several measures you can take to protect yourself against cybercrime:   Perform regular updates: Install updates as soon as they become available to protect your devices.   Use a virus scanner: Secure your devices with a virus scanner, firewall, and script blockers.   Use secure passwords: Choose long passphrases and use different passwords for each account.

This slogan frames the officer as an accomplice of an oppressive government. In the exhibition\'s videos, officers are reframed, not by a specific group of people, but by various individuals who determine who they see from their own perspective. By omitting the word \'Bastards\' in the title, space is created to reflect on the question: "How do I look at the Dutch police?   “””   Example answer when a visitor asks the  question: What is the intention of "All Cops Are"?   “””   The intention of "All Cops Are" is to create hopeful new spaces and movements that help both the police and society to learn and progress.
